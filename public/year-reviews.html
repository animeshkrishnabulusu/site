        <h2>My previous year activities</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>2022</summary>
            <p>2022 is a post covid year for me. The first few months were a blur. I processed
                lesser as the days went by. I produced almost nothing. People wouldn't
                understand. People wouldn't want to understand. For I am not unique. Everyone
                had troubled times. Everyone suffered in their own ways.</p>
            <p>I worked on a team that helped migrate a customer from CloudFormation to
                Terraform. It is a total paradigm shift personally. On the bright side, I got a
                good glimpse into insfrastructure as code, Terraform, and IAC based strategies.
                I have gained a massive appreciation for IAC based DevOps.</p>
            <p>One thing I achieved is the AWS solution architect associate certification. The
                saying that goes on the lines of "The more we know, we realize how much we don't
                know" is never more truer. But anyway, with a happy sigh, I am onto the
                professional one now.</p>
            <p>I have watched 4 films at the theater. It was an unexpected and a pleasant
                surprise. 2019 was my best year for moviegoing with 2 films for many years until
                then. And then, this year outdoes that year by 200%. It was a surprise because I
                realized that there are still some kinds of movies that I would love to watch.
            </p>
            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Write IAC code and make mistakes from day one. There is no time to do deep
                    thoughts and analysis. </li>
                <li>Working with DevOps engineers and working as a DevOps engineer are
                    completely different things. The experience of understanding Linux and
                    command line things well does not translate into being an effective DevOps
                    engineer. Practice my friend.</li>
                <li>We cannot summon god mode productivity and discipline on command. It is a
                    myth. It is either your overinflated ego or your ADHD talking. It doesn't
                    work like that. While god mode is possible, we must first be a
                    karmayogi<sup>1</sup>. This ties in with my existing beliefs of goals vs
                    systems. To become a karmayogi, one must first build on systems. Systems, in
                    turn, are built on habits.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>I traveled slightly better than <a href="/2021">previous year</a>. These are some
                pictures from this year.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The year 2021 has been eventful. A year of learning, travel and covid.</p>
            <p>On technological front, I have been able to navigate the software architecture
                fundamentals, distributed design fundamentals, amazon web services, go language
                and some .NET sprinkled. It is a great new beginning. Finally I got the right
                inspiration to work on two of my favorite projects.</p>
            <p>On a personal front, I went through two amazing trips through South India, got
                some new geek toys, and got covid in the last week of the year.</p>
            <p>I don't have many numbers this year, but have some learnings and photos from my
                trips.</p>
            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>Here are my most prized learnings (key concepts in bold)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Embrace <strong>habits and discipline</strong> in place of motivation and
                        productivity</p>
                    <p>This is a self-realization that occurred several years ago and I tested
                        it in my various short-term and long-term activities and plans. Finally,
                        I am fully convinced of this. This ties into one of my other favorite
                        approaches to life - Goals vs Systems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Streaks are good but <strong>spaced repetition</strong> learning is
                        better.</p>
                    <p>On learning platforms such as Pluralsight, you get badges for continuous
                        learning. For example, the <em>Back to Back 5x</em> badge. This badge
                        indicates that you have learned something each day for 5 days in a row.
                        It makes you feel good. It is actually good when you want to skim
                        something you already know or want a gain cursory knowledge on a topic.
                        However, for deeper understanding and skill building, it is best for you
                        to learn your topic with <a href="https://sive.rs/srs">spaced
                            repetition</a>.</p>
                    <p>To learn more about this technique, go through the <a
                           href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/">Learning
                            how to learn course</a> on Coursera.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Prepare for burnouts</strong> and avoid mini-heartaches and other
                        mess</p>
                    <p>I first learned of the word burnout when I worked in a startup. It took
                        me about a decade to know that burnouts still occur despite knowing of
                        them if they are not identified and managed earlier. Some tips include:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep the work ticking and reduce unproductive days. This doesn't
                            mean that you need to crank out code every single hour. Sometimes it
                            helps to focus on those technical debt items that you have on the
                            backlog. Sometimes you may want to work on infrastructure stuff.
                        </li>
                        <li>Plan for staggered flow moments. i.e. scheduled flow moments on your
                            calendar. Google calendar and Microsoft Outlook now have ways to
                            help you achieve this. Personally, instead of letting them control
                            my time, I manually set these flow moments on a daily basis.</li>
                        <li>Plan vacations way ahead of time. This is absolutely key. I suggest
                            this to my team members always and forget to do it myself.</li>
                        <li>Set boundaries. Talk to your lead or manager and let them know about
                            your productive times, off-times. Avoid weekdays and overtimes as
                            much as possible. Talking ahead of time about this will help you get
                            into a good habit.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Minimal <strong>exercise and portion-controlled diet</strong> will save
                        you</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Morning walk, brisk walk in your jail-sized room, some pushups and
                            pullups, and may be some weightlifting.</li>
                        <li>Eat in a smaller plate, one serving. James Clear has a <a
                               href="https://jamesclear.com/feeling-fat">good thought
                                process</a> on this.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Be <strong>paranoid about hygiene</strong>, better safe than sorry.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rethink your hygiene routine. There is always a room for
                            improvement.</li>
                        <li>In today's capitalistic and individualist societies, it is hard to
                            convince everyone. Find better and effective ways to be hygienic, be
                            it food or your ambient surroundings.</li>
                        <li>Some people will always think you are an ass. It is okay. You cannot
                            control their thoughts, only your actions</li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>Misc</h3>
            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>Some quotes, new and old, that I liked:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only
                    plan, but also believe. - Anatole France</p>
                <p>It's affinity and communication, and an empathy for the human condition, that
                    binds us all, and keeps a soul in wonder. - Homeless guy on Loudermilk
                </p>

            <p>I write this note around the end of December. The process is simple. I fight a
                baggage of depression and disappointments laced with chaotic thinking. This
                manifests into something I call a year-in-review. This year did not end on time
                for me. It took three extra months for me to finally move forward.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of March, we got wind of a single Covid-19 infection in a nearby
                IT park. Our team decided to go back home for the week. In most of our minds, we
                already knew that this is going to be semi long-term thing.</p>
            <p>I was low-key ecstatic with the prospect of working from home. I realized around
                end of 2014 that my productivity was much higher when working at home. That
                thought sat in my head. After a while, I noticed some thought leaders pushing
                for remote work and the perils of open offices.</p>
            <p>I have been reading a lot of opinions on developer culture and developer
                experience for a while now. Some of them include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Negative costs of interrupting an engineer at work</li>
                <li>Cost-benefits associated with remote work</li>
                <li>Futility of open workspace</li>
                <li>capital A agile</li>
                <li>10x engineer, 1x engineer</li>
                <li>and so on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With all this knowledge and bent of mind coupled, I believed and concluded that
                WFH, or remote work, is what I need. So I was happy about coming back home.</p>
            <p>Yet, I did not know what was in store. Nobody did. The term new normal spread
                like wildfire when it was evident that there is no clear end in sight. This is
                no chaos. This is a cataclysm. An event that forever changes all society.</p>
            <p>I was ready for wearing a mask. I started using an anti-pollution mask during the
                daily commute in November 2019. It worked wonders on my breathing and outlook
                for the day. So I was ready.</p>
            <p>Split into three phases, this is how I went through the year - descent,
                despair and depression.</p>
            <p><strong>Descent</strong></p>
            <p>As a thinker and an introvert, it felt normal to work from home. Yes, I am an
                introvert. Lately, I am rather proud about this fact.</p>
            <p>I love solitude and quiet. I value a focus friendly ambience. This makes it
                difficult for me to work in noisy workspaces, especially the ones with open
                plans.</p>
            <p>Full of hope, I preached to close colleagues about the virtues of working from
                home. All I needed to do was show up on time and follow some best practices to
                be productive while remote. All is good. Some habits and lifestyle changes
                happened organically. Some good, some bad.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eating less rice - This led losing nearly 5kgs within a month without
                    much exercise and next to no outdoor activities. I lived only on oatmeal,
                    millets, and curries and dal. To fend off hunger pangs in the gaps, I took
                    to sweet and salty snacks.</li>
                <li>Daily weight watching - Above diet constraint resulted in checking my
                    weight multiple times a day. I kept a weight scale next to my desk for this.
                </li>
                <li>Staggered work hours - Then, a pattern emerged gradually wherein I
                    worked for 2 hours and then was off work for 1 hour, repeatedly, until the
                    end of the day. This culminated into often working 12-14 hours per day. I
                    noticed my productivity tapering off as the worktime became more splattered
                    across the day for several weeks.</li>
                <li>Dark mode - As I worked at night more often, I embraced dark mode
                    wherever possible. Visual Studio sucked in dark mode.</li>
                <li>Bad sleep - I got things done late at night, not to catchup on
                    tomorrows work, but to finish the high-profile tasks of the day. This
                    devolved into playing catching up most of the week. This was troublesome as
                    some nights, I was just tired to do any mental work. I got less and less
                    sleep around June.</li>
                <li>Polyphasic sleep - I looked for opportunities for sleeping during the
                    day, 20 minutes at a time. It was good for a few days. Then those 20 minutes
                    swiftly turned into 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Binge watching TV shows - Just one show, The Office. I watched it
                    entire 9 seasons 5 times in a row.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This turned into a bad burnout and lasted about a month. I figured I will take a
                break, work in a senior developer role, get my focus back etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Despair</strong></p>
            <p>I did not get that break. I am choosy about the work I intend to do, but I had to
                relent and begin another assignment.</p>
            <p>This assignment was a golden opportunity to understand enterprise architecture in
                a great team. But, my mindset was not receptive. I was looking to cruise, but
                the work kept piling up. Not a stranger to this situation, but in such cases, I
                usually plan some power-through sessions to get on top of the work. This was
                different.</p>
            <p>I became ever so argumentative, restless and impatient. The work suffered. I kept
                having the same discussion, reading through the same codebase on a loop, kept
                asking the same questions. These situations devolved into having fights with the
                manager. This frustrated me daily. There was some fault on the other side as
                well. But, that's not what is important. I hated every moment in that assignment
                as my behaviour caused some collateral damage to the team.</p>
            <p>One of my much younger colleagues, was very kind, despite repetitive questions
                and discussions. His positivity and general demeanor helped me regain some
                levelheadedness. Thanks Jatin.</p>
            <p>I watched The Office 4 more times in this phase, bringing the total to 15 times.
                I moved onto a new assignment after a very short break. I got hit with many
                health issues somewhere in phase two. I addressed these with doctor visits
                immediately during this break.</p>
            <p><strong>Depression</strong></p>
            <p>Depression is not generally a phase for me. It is a state of mind for a good part
                of the last 2 decades. But this time, it became a separate phase. My behavior
                just threw me into deeper depths than I have seen before. At that point, I did a
                deeper dive into self to gain more perspective and see newer avenues for a cure.
            </p>
            <p>After the initial onset of the vicious cycle of self-loathing and anger, I came
                to my senses about a plenty of things that left me in a persistent depressed
                state in the first place.</p>
            <p>I evaluated and reevaluated many significant actions and decisions going back 15+
                years. I pinpointed my failures to a personal attribute and searched for ways to
                either overcome or step around that attribute. I incorporated more gratitude,
                lesser ego and big-picture thinking.</p>
            <p>One of other significant things I have done after a long time is to rethink my
                purpose. This helped evaluate my current and past relationships and laid a path
                forward.</p>
            <p>The bright side was that all of this did not feel new or scary. I still have my
                tools to fight and embrace it. It took me some time-off and good discussions
                with my parents and mentors who helped me see the light. Thank you to my parents
                and my managers.</p>
            <p>In this new assignment, I also learned a bunch of new things. This cured me
                somewhat of the recent mental state. I have also managed to complete a major
                course work at my workplace. It was significant and has enabled me to identify
                my career path.</p>
            <h3>Realizations</h3>
            <p>Some new realizations I happened upon:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Drastic cutdown of carbs affected my energy levels</li>
                <li>Dark mode is not effective if you are working more than 8 hours a day</li>
                <li>Polyphasic sleep may not be effective without a solid 5+ hours sleep the
                    night before</li>
                <li>I love data visualization.</li>
                <li>The senior engineer in me became rusty.</li>
                <li>Usual opinions on The Office stop making sense after you have watched it
                    enough times. For example: Karen was not right for Jim. David Wallace was
                    not as good a boss as we tend to think.</li>
                <li>Sometimes you don't have to work on good projects. They are still good
                    projects without you. You just may not fit some projects.</li>
                <li>Key and Peele may break your addiction to The Office.</li>
                <li>For the first time, I started saying it is okay when I mess up the smallest
                    thing, professional or personal, instead of self-flagellation.</li>
                <li>Remote work is still good, but now, I can see the other side of it. For
                    remote work to be moderately successful, you need at least two things. <ol>
                        <li>a team that is aligned with asynchronous communication patterns</li>
                        <li>good remote work <a

            <h3>Self</h3>
            <p>Introspection has become one of my guiding processes this year.</p>
            <p>A few years back, I was visiting a friend after a long time. He asked me if I
                wanted to drive his car. I said okay. As I was nearing the driver side, he asked
                "Are you still angry?"</p>
            <p>It was a question from the <abbr title="out of the blue">left field</abbr>. "What
                do you mean?", I replied. Though I knew what he meant, I couldn't process the
                fact that someone asked me that question. Nobody has ever asked me that. Even I
                have never thought to ask myself this. It triggered many questions within me.
            </p>
            <p><em>Why did he ask me this?</em><br>
                <em>How did he know this about me?</em><br>
                <em>How did he think to ask this?</em><br>
                <em>Did he go through similar situations in life?</em><br>
                <em>Did he know someone who went through this?</em>
            </p>
            <p>It ended up with me thinking about the core thing of it.</p>
            <p><em>Why am I still angry?</em><br>
                <em>Why am I angry at all?</em>
            </p>
            <p>This line of thinking stuck with me for a while and kicked off my journey into
                self. Rather than hating myself or my circumstances, I started learning more
                about myself. I started to see the silver lining in my failures. I realized my
                failure was a perceived failure. It was as if a cloud cover was coming off to
                reveal a beautiful day.</p>
            <p>Yet, I lived with anger for a good while after that. The reason was that while I
                could understand my anger, I had no control over my it. I didn't know what my
                triggers were. I hurt quite a few loved ones even years after my first
                realization. I could justify some of my outbursts, but I did not realize the
                emotional impact on others and myself.</p>
            <p>There was one incident where I wasn't able to respond to a team member despite
                empathizing with them. For some reason, my heartbeat raised a bit when I was
                about to react to their request. After a few times of this happening one thing
                became clear. The trigger was my expectation of how the collaboration should be
                and not the team member.</p>
            <p>I anticipated the next interaction. I slowed down my breathing and responded with
                facts and did not let my "expectations" hold sway over me. After the
                interaction, I remember being in good spirits for the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>This incident afforded me the knowledge that it is possible, with some hard work,
                to be a calmer person. I recollected the above conversation with my friend. I
                could see that I needed to work on my anger.</p>
            <p>Soon, it dawned upon me that it is hard. How could I show a calmer demeanor in a
                stressful and emotional situation? How could one behave the opposite of what
                they are feeling?</p>
            <p>I realized meditation, mindfulness, stoicism and zen habits may help. Since I
                have already some experience with it, I decided to apply mindfulness. My
                rudimentary understanding of this technique, so far, is to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>slow down your perception</li>
                <li>understand what is being consumed by your relevant senses</li>
                <li>analyze how you are now feeling and how you are about to react </li>
                <li>then respond rather than react if in an interaction with other person</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Responding means to actually respond to the other person in a calmer and a
                collected manner. Use only facts and not opinions. It is as if you would reply
                when completely sane. Think of being in a job interview or in a live TV show.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you <em>Swapnil</em> for asking me that question. It changed my life.</p>
            <h3>Productivity</h3>
            <p>I removed my Netflix subscription after catching up with all the major series. As
                expected, this has resulted in a significant increase of personal time.</p>
            <p>I use Sync for Reddit and removed all the subreddit subscriptions including
                /r/all and /r/popular. I have yet to find a way to do something similar for HN.

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>I started <a href="/how-i-settled-on-react/">learning</a> react.js.</p>
            <p>A few years back I made a few attempts both with .NET Core 1.0 and .NET Core 1.1,
                but stopped after the things were moving faster than I could keep up with. First
                the CLI tools switch from <code>dnx</code> and <code>dnvm</code> to
                <code>dotnet</code> and then the project file format switch from
                <code>.json</code> back to <code>.csproj</code>. After .NET Core 2x become
                relatively stable, I have resumed my explorations and adventures with .NET Core
                and all surrounding technologies to build awesome applications on Linux. These
                would be mostly web applications. </p>
            <p>I happened upon an opportunity to prepare for a super technical whiteboard
                interview. I failed it, but it was one of the most exciting moments this year.
                This experience helped me understand where I stood w.r.t. algorithms, data
                structures and problem solving. I took to these websites like leetcode and
                codewars to try and solve a few problems.</p>
            <p>I couldn't continue my work after a while on the freelance side project I took up
                last year. It was a heartbreaking decision to stop working on it. Lesson learned

            <p>Bye 2018. Hello 2019.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>2017</summary>
            <p>Until the end of November, I was brimming with words about all my experiences
                this year and could not wait to write this post. As the month of December rolled
                by with its holiday charms and end of the year reprieve, I found it to difficult
                to articulate, even internally, all of those words and thoughts. So I began
                writing this piece a little ahead to compose my thoughts and self.</p>
            <h3>Break</h3>
            <p>Life took quite the turn this year after I had decided to take a brief break from
                my career and stay at home to spend time with my son.</p>
            <p>For the first few weeks, it felt like a really bad move. I could feel the walls
                closing in around me. My mind was attuned to being in a day job regardless of
                the productivity. The withdrawal period felt quite intense. I could see a few
                familiar dark places again and was well on my way into stepping into them.
                Familiarity with the situation helped me look for an out, several of which I
                have learned to seek for in moments such as this.</p>
            <p>After stumbling for a while, I found my rhythm. What helped me most in taking
                care of activities is to break down each activity into a series of steps, kind
                of like an algorithm, and then optimize for efficiency each time something hit
                me. There were a number of situations where I lost my cool and calm, but having
                an understanding spouse made those times better. It took me from thinking "Oh
                no!" over and over again to searching for possible bright sides to attaining
                peace and calm.</p>
            <p>It was a slow realization that my situation was incredible. It made me realize
                that even when I am in a bind, I could eke out a bit of a productive time on a
                regular basis and slowly build a habit out of it. </p>
            <p>This experience taught me that it is important to acknowledge family time as it
                comes and let everything else become a second priority. It has also helped me
                realized all the things I was missing in life.</p>
            <h3>Netflix</h3>
            <p>Having a lot of time on my hands this year, I turned to Netflix. I caught up with
                a lot of shows I was meaning to watch for a long time.</p>
            <p>I binged the following shows in about two months.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Office (US)</li>
                <li>Breaking Bad</li>
                <li>Parks and Recreation</li>
                <li>Arrested Development</li>
                <li>Master of None</li>
                <li>Better Call Saul</li>
                <li>New Girl</li>
                <li>House of Cards</li>
                <li>Black Mirror</li>
                <li>IT Crowd</li>
                <li>Brooklyn Nine Nine</li>
                <li>Ozark</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A few shows I started watching, but couldn't fully complete.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</li>
                <li>Community</li>
                <li>The Good Place</li>
                <li>The West Wing</li>
                <li>The Vice Principals</li>
                <li>Mad Men</li>
                <li>The Wire</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After being out of the loop about so many jokes and quotes, I could finally
                retroactively understand tons of Reddit comments after completing The Office and
                Arrested Development. That was a weird high.</p>
            <p>Eagerly awaiting new seasons on Better Call Saul, Black Mirror and Ozark, and a
                few other shows.</p>
            <h3>Django</h3>
            <p>Earlier this year, I started learning Django to build an application for a
                friend. I followed the official tutorial and few other guides to get started. I
                am loving every minute of learning Django. Coming from an ASP.NET MVC
                background, it felt refreshing. In the coming days, I hope I could write a bit
                about the things I learned.</p>
            <h3>2018</h3>
            <p>I have no clue what I would do. Let's wait and see.</p>
            <p>Since 2016, I started writing down a list of things I have done in the current
                year rather than setting up new goals and resolutions for the upcoming year.
                Keeping up with that tradition, here is a short summary of this year.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Became a stay-at-home dad</li>
                <li>Learned Django and kept working on an application</li>
                <li>Binged on a bunch of TV Shows</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Current distraction list</strong></p>
            <p>React, Webpack, Typescript, .NET Core, C++, Python, D3, VueJS, CSS.</p>
            <p>Goodbye 2017. Hello 2018!</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>2016</summary>
            <p>I have learned from my efforts in years 2012 and 2013 that creating fresh new
                year resolutions don't often work for various reasons. Not for everybody at the
                least.</p>
            <p>It is then that I have decided that I would write about what I have achieved in
                that year rather than what I would like to achieve in the next year. Last year
                has been a good year for me in that regard. I did not have any specific plan
                coming into 2016.</p>
            <h3>D3</h3>
            <p>I had a great opportunity at work to learn <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>,
                a JavaScript library for creating web-based interactive charts and
                visualizations. This is a library that lets you build any kind of visualization
                from scratch. This means it would give you control of all aspects of your
                visualization. This is what it makes it so powerful, but it means that initially
                it would take a good amount of time for the implementation. Thankfully, I was
                given ample time to learn the basics of d3.</p>
            <p>Anecdotally, it took me about two weeks to implement a multi line chart and two
                more weeks to understand what each line of code was meant for. It would take, at
                best, an hour or two to get this kind of a chart up and running with <a
                   href="https://www.highcharts.com/">HighCharts</a>, another popular JavaScript
                library for creating interactive charts and visualizations.</p>
            <p>Then I was tasked to create a custom chart which somewhat resembled a box plot,
                but with a lot of interactivity based on user inputs on other parts of the page.
                The first prototype of this chart took me about three days to create. It was one
                of the best moments of 2016. Once the prototype was nailed down, for the
                management and synchronization of data from various sources, I used AngularJs
                (1x).</p>
            <p>This kind of a high is <em>the</em> best thing about programming and I am glad I
                got introduced to d3 to rediscover it, thanks to my awesome customer at the
                time.</p>
            <p>Learning d3 also helped me understand what SVG is and why it is so awesome. This
                has also forced me to look deep into Javascript and made me fell in love with
                the language all over again.</p>
            <h3>New blog</h3>
            <p>Though node.js based static generators are all the rage, I chose to a go a
                different route. Another programming language I use and love is Python. What
                better an opportunity to use and customize a tool written using that language?
                So I have evaluated Python based static generators and chose <a
                   href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>.</p>
            <p>I have gained basic understanding about building responsive interfaces. I have
                discovered <a href="https://milligram.github.io/">milligram.css</a> in the
                process.</p>
            <p>As outlined in my first <a href="/hello-lektor/">post</a> on this blog, I started
                updating this blog with a few of the desired features.</p>
            <h3>2017 and ahead</h3>
            <p>The biggest change I will be making is that I will be taking a short career break
                to spend more time with my family.</p>
            <p>Apart from that, I have a tons of items in my <a
                   href="/tackling-distractions/">distraction log</a> accumulated from the last
                couple of years.</p>
            <p>Leaflet, React, Aurelia, Gulp, Webpack, Node, WebGL, Typescript, Xamarin, UWP,
                Android, Pyramid, Phoenix, .NET Core, Vibe.d, C++, Ruby, ES6, Tableau, BI+DWH,
                ML, Tensorflow, Data Science, Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p>Despite the huge list, I know I will be focused on a few things at the most and
                that time will be utilized more toward building something useful rather than
                learning how to do specific things in a particular technology.</p>
            <p>Goodbye 2016. Hello 2017!</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>2012</summary>
            <p>2012 was the year I wished things would just work. That line of thinking, for a
                lack of better word, was escapist.</p>
            <p>I have to make it work for things to just work and fall into place. I did not
                persist when it felt tiresome. I took necessary breaks without resuming back to
                whatever I was supposed to be doing. I gave up a lot many times than I should.
            </p>
            <p>At the start of the year, I created a schedule to follow in the hope of becoming
                a better person. I hoped to blog four times a month, workout every Sunday, go
                out for a photowalk each Saturday and continue practicing programming stuff. I
                failed to follow the schedule on all the activities except the programming
                practice.</p>
            <p>My first open source project attempt fizzled after couple of months, my physical
                fitness hit an all time low, I felt a stranger to my own camera, and never had a
                wholesome moment in terms of happiness or work satisfaction.</p>
            <p>On a more personal front, there were both things which I wished should happen and
                things I never thought would happen. I never seemed to have a grip on most of
                the personal moments that really mattered.</p>
            <p>It was as if some part of me consciously sought failure constantly. A part of me
                which did not root for the home team. It almost feels like I had a
                predisposition for attracting negativity. A part which hated the pain of
                discipline and hardwork. To think that I even allowed that feeling to exist
                within me is disappointing.</p>
            <p>But, not everything was bad though. There were some valuable lessons learned and
                hard hitting realizations.</p>
            <p>I learned that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>it is perfectly okay to chase my dream even if I am not in my prime and that
                    the important thing is to have tried and continue to work toward it.</li>
                <li>it is perfectly okay even if it meant that I end up a shitty writer, blogger
                    or a programmer. </li>
                <li>it is perfectly okay to work in sub optimal conditions when trying to prove
                    a point to self. </li>
                <li>it is perfectly okay if I never venture into film-making.</li>
                <li>it is perfectly okay to separate passion from work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The major thing I did in 2012 was to go back to a programming career. I did this
                for myself even if it meant that I would end up with lesser pay. Though I always
                hated the buzzword oriented programming projects coupled with bureaucracy, I
                have driven myself constantly toward getting accustomed to it in an effort to
                both stay employed as well as continue to work toward being a "programmer".</p>
            <p>There were plenty of "oh shit" moments, but I persisted, thanks to advices from a
                best friend and senior.</p>
            <p>This is what I classify as my success of 2012. Though it is an ongoing process, I
                am impressed with what I put up so far.</p>
            <p>Last year, my failures outnumbered the successes. What went wrong? Why were there
                so many failures? </p>
            <p>I can think of two things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of focus. </li>
                <li>Lack of follow-through. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This resulted in constant accumulation of unmanageable bits and pieces of life
                leading to an expected and heavy disappointment. I liken this feeling to a bad
                hangover, which has no quick "lemon juice" cure. The only way I see to succeed
                amidst the looming negativity is to suck it up and remove all the clutter and
                distraction and get things done on time. No hesitating. No complaining. And no
                excuses.</p>
            <p>Though I am pushing to be 30 this year, I did not lose my passion for becoming
                better. I would like to share three of my biggest motivating factors that helped
                me hold on to it.</p>
            <h3>Three things</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</strong></p>
            <p>Some time last year I watched the movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. In that movie,
                one thing stuck to me.</p>
            <p>There is a scene in which the three friends go deep sea diving. Once they are all
                back on their boat, one of the characters cries realizing how much he has lost
                in life in the rush to make it big.</p>
            <p>Then a resonating poem is recited in the background:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Dilon mein tum apni betaabiyaan leke chal rahe ho, Toh zinda ho tum<br> Nazar
                    mein khwaabon ki bijliyaan leke chal rahe ho, Toh zinda ho tum</p>
                <p>Hawaa ke jhonkon ke jaise azad rehna seekho<br> Tum ek dariya ke jaise lehron
                    mein behna seekho<br> Har ek lamhe se tum milo khole apni baahein<br> Har ek
                    pal ik naya samaan dekhein yeh nigaahein</p>
                <p>Jo apni aankhon mein hairaaniyaan leke chal rahe ho, Toh zinda ho tum<br>
                    Dilon mein tum apni betaabiyaan leke chal rahe ho, Toh zinda ho tum</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>and its english translation:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>If you have eagerness in your heart, it means you are alive.<br> If your eyes
                    are filled with dreams, it means you are alive.</p>
                <p>Learn to be free like the wind,<br> Learn to flow freely like the river,<br>
                    Embrace every moment with open arms,<br> See a new horizon every time with
                    your eyes,</p>
                <p>If you carry surprise in your eyes, it means you are alive,<br> If you have
                    eagerness in your heart, it means you are alive.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In a time when I completely lost track of what I wanted to professionally, this
                particular scene in the movie became my biggest wake up call. I decided to
                continue becoming what I have started out with in my career - a developer.
                I knew it was difficult. I knew it was a troublesome journey, considering most
                people settle down for a lead or a manager role around this time. But I knew it
                had to be done.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Little Miss Sunshine</strong></p>
            <p>I am nowhere near where I wanted to be, but, though late, I have started an
                arduous journey. There are times, however, when I don't feel like swimming
                against the current. That is when I like to remind myself of <a
                   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Miss_Sunshine">Richard Hoover's</a>
                motivating words from his speech in his 9-step Refuse to Lose program:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>No hesitating. No complaining. And no excuses.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In the movie, though Richard Hoover struggles to build a career as a life coach,

            <p><strong>3. Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong></p>
            <p>Once I was feeling very low and was browsing reddit and by chance found a quote
                from Neil deGrasse Tyson:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look
                    for things like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting
                    behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people recognize, that in
                    life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they
                    generate their own motivation.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A person who was looking for motivation in life asked his advice and he received
                the above. This thing may be the one that tipped me off of my uncertainty and
                anxiety into a person bent on becoming a developer.</p>
            <p>This could possibly be the reason behind my few successes last year. Now I want
                to reduce the failure count and get back on track to achieving all my short term
                goals and set down a path to make my long term goals a reality.</p>
            <p>So, I vow to keep it simple and functional this year by following my mom's golden
                principle for getting things done:</p>
            <p><strong>FOCUS!</strong></p>
            <h3>Resolutions</h3>
            <p>Here is an list of items I plan to do in 2013.</p>
            <p>
            <p class="active">Narrator: <em>He didn't.</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go out and do a brisk walk, with short bursts of jogging. (Everyday)</li>
                <li>ENFORCE Strict Pomodoro / Chrome Nanny! DO NOT disable them. (Everyday)</li>
                <li>Sleep everyday by 11PM. (Everyday)</li>
                <li>Write a minimum of 4 blog posts per week, with the usual topics being: </li>
                <li>dev-log (at the least once a week)</li>
                <li>review/updates post (every week, preferably on Friday)</li>
                <li>some linux thingy (once a month at the least)</li>
                <li>photography/software development/programming/teaching (whenever thoughts
                    race)</li>
                <li>self-improvement (occasionally)</li>
                <li>On Saturdays, either go for a neighborhood photowalk, or take camera
                    everywhere you go.</li>
                <li>Continue learning Python and Erlang and write about either of them on
                    Sundays.</li>
                <li>Listen to podcasts (3 hours twice a week)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Plan for 2013</b></p>
            <p>Stick to what I am doing. Practice often. Take surprise tests. Stay in touch with
                the technology updates. Keep working on personal projects. Plan for eventual
                certifications.</p>
            <p><strong>Dealing with burnout</strong></p>
            <p>Adhere to a food discipline. Have breakfast, avoid sugar and caffeine, drinks
                copious amounts of water. Do not worry about work at home. Unwind
                <s>occasionally</s> frequently. Go for a walk, cook for your family or partner,
                organize desk, update shopping lists. Physical activity at work. If nothing, do
                some stretches.</p>
            <p><strong>Writing a regular dev-log</strong></p>
            <p>(A dev-log is a weekly update about my programming work)</p>
            <p>Write a summary of what programming work you could get done that week.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal</strong></p>
            <p>Schedule some activity immediately after you get home. Spend time with your
                family or partner.</p>
            <p>Hello and welcome, Twenty thirteen!</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>2011</summary>
            <p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
            <p>I am including my org-plan for 2012 here, since most of my new year resolutions
                this year are about sticking to a schedule. I always believe that making
                something public is ten times more effective when you want results.</p>
            <p>
            <p class="active">Narrator: <em>No it doesn't.</em></p>
            <p>So here goes my plan.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>exercise regularly</li>
                <li>do a twitter 365</li>
                <li>a photowalk every sunday morning</li>
                <li>update flickr stream weekly</li>
                <li>blog once a week</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
