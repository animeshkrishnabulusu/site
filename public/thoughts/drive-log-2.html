    <h1>Drive Log 2</h1>
    <h2>Rehabilitation of mind</h2>
    <main>
        <article>
            <div><time datetime="2012-11-11">Nov 11, 2012</time></div>

            <p>
                Today I woke up from an odd dream. I wondered for a while why the dream did not continue despite no
                external disturbances. I then made myself ready for a drive.

            <p>We went toward the IT park like the last time.</p>

            <p>I feared I would feel as if I were starting from scratch, since the last drive was fifteen days ago. I
                was mildly surprised that I did not feel intimidated by all the gear shifting that was to come ahead.
            </p>

            <p>This time I had fewer hiccups on the road, be it U-turns or slowing down when it needed. I sensed the
                driver in me was coming back. I was reminded of how much I used to dig driving while I was in the
                States.</p>

            <p>I ventured a bit further onto the main road this time, toward Lingampally. I kept going. After missing a
                traffic light, I began being careful. I drove for a bit on the road toward Mehdipatnam and then decided
                to turn toward Hitech city.</p>

            <p>I realized I would encounter my "first" traffic light in a long time. I slowed down as I approached the
                junction and came to a halt. I did not get down to neutral as I was supposed to. I was holding clutch
                all the way down in second gear and waited for the green.</p>

            <p>As it would be, a lot of vehicles piled up behind me. Suddenly I was overcome by the thought of not
                being able to accelerate appropriately and getting stuck right where I stood. I could hear my own
                heartbeat and waited nervously for the signal. The moment the signal turned green, my heart was racing.
                I was still in second gear. I released the clutch and accelerated a bit and moved a bit forward. Not
                having accelerated enough, I could hear the dreaded sounds coming from the vehicle indicating an
                impending and unconvenient halt.</p>

            <p>At that moment, I don't really recollect what drove me further, but neither did I panic and step on the
                brakes, nor did I accelerate out of control. I kept going on and that actually worked. Yeah, I had no
                reason to panic. I am not new to the roads and controlled acceleration was something I could do without
                much effort.</p>

            <p>I was able to steer out of the junction and move ahead. I gave up a bit further down the road citing the
                driving being a bit more "stressful" than on low-traffic roads.</p>

            <p>Though my father was silent for the most part, I could see that he was amply irked. He mentioned
                something about becoming more confident only if I drive in the "real" traffic. He was right.</p>

            <p>I am hoping to do that next time.
