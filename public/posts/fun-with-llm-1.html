            <div><time datetime="2025-08-23">Aug 23, 2025</time></div>
            <p>Last week I was aggregating several practice projects into a git repository with
                one single solution (.sln). I looked through some files and realized how much
                stuff needed updates. One of them was a piece of code that sorted an integer
                list based on the selected sorting strategy. I had this written down many years
                ago while trying to get into common GoF design patterns. </p>
            <pre>var unsortedList = new List&lt;int&gt; { 19, 9, 48, 3, 11, 41 };

var sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy());
sorter.Sort(unsortedList); 

sorter = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy());
sorter.Sort(unsortedList);</pre>
            <p>As a pesky believer of boy scout principle, I had to make some change here.
                Should I implement the sorts? - it means a quick re-learning of sorting
                algorithms; should I update the project to dotnet v9/10 - easy and not so
                interesting; should I benchmark the sorting approaches? - sounds interesting.
                Let's do this. I kept postponing this activity for quite some time now, so I
                thanked my brain for the timely recollection.
            <p>Immediately I pasted the snippet into a big-LLM and asked it<sup>*</sup> to get
                me started with benchmarking code. It gave me a lot of code specific to
                BenchmarkDotNet.
            <blockquote><sup>*</sup> Due to the big-LLMs, some lazy programmers become dumber
                (sample size = 1). Emphasis on the dumb. </blockquote>
            <p>The good part was that the code worked without having to change the benchmarking
                part at all. It took about 10 minutes. The bad part was I was lost looking at
                all the code. How did it make a certain decision to write a code in a particular
                way? On top of that, I had no idea why a particular thing had been written in
                such a way. Is it at advanced expertise? Is it the most fundamental way of
                writing BenchmarkDotNet?
            <p>The one thing I was certain of was that the output code was useful in exact
                specific context of sorting. It could not be genericized in a way that would
                fits various use-cases and problems. I could not take away the parts I would
                call a building block. If I were to adapt the code to something else say a
                complex business logic involving come computation and a bunch of I/O-bound
                calls, I would be staring at the screen for a long time.</p>
            <p> This is what one gets when they don't go straight to the documentation. I do
                admit that my original prompt was limited. I actually know how to write an
                extensive prompt to get what I want. However that is a lot of work. I'd rather
                spend that work writing my code and benchmarking code, and tweaking all of it.
            </p>
            <p>So I told the big-LLM nicely that this works only for the sorting and that I want
                to know how to benchmark all sorts of code. It took me a while to get a list of
                useful things. Things like best practices, things to keep in mind,
                dos-and-donts, one page checklist. However, after a few prompts, I realized all
                of this would never be my hard-earned knowledge and experience. I would have to
                first pay my time dues in getting to know the ins and outs of BenchmarkDotNet. I
                have this need to know things at a deeper level first. Then I am happy to forget
                that for long periods of time and come back to it at a later point in time. At
                which point, then asking a big-LLM is probably better. Benchmarking is one such
                area of expertise that is always worth the showcase especially both in
                enterprise and in the open-source world</p>
            <p>In the one of the next posts, I will document my learnings of using
                BenchmarkDotNet appropriately for a wide variety of use-cases. At least some
                common ones, hopefully.</p>
            <p>My key lessons from this activity are, in this order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>For important areas of expertise, start with and consult the documentation,
                    and then build on top of that knowledge.</li>
                <li>Then consult a big-LLM, and keep prompts as specific as possible for
                    real-world usefulness.</li>
            </ol>
